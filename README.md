# Bluetooth-Mtu-Checker
Bluetooth MTU Checker is an attempt to distinguish a target BLE device's maximum Bluetooth MTU size, which can be useful in a lot of situations.

This is an early stage prototype, currently seeking other ways to integrate this feature to make it actually useful.

**Note**: this will only work on [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) devices, MTU doesn't concern normal Bluetooth communications.
