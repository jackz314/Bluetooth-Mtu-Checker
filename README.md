# Bluetooth-Mtu-Checker
Bluetooth MTU Checker is an attempt to distinguish a target BLE device's maximum Bluetooth MTU size, which can be useful in a lot of situations.

This is an early stage prototype, currently seeking other ways to integrate this feature to make it actually useful. At the current stage of this app, it's not meant for production use. The MTU result is not thoroughly tested and cannot be guaranteed to be accurate

**Note**: this will only work on [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) devices, MTU doesn't concern normal Bluetooth communications.
